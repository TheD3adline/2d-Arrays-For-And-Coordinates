# 2d-Arrays-For-And-Coordinates
Little practice for me to develop a definitive way how to properly implement
a 2D Array in Java without frying my brain everytime I try to iterate through
it with a for loop. It needs to line up properly with an actual x y math coordinate
system, not have the axes reversed so my brain can work with it.

I did this little practice to refresh my knowledge on the topic, because I noticed
that I still ran into issues to make proper sense of it all when working on the
Conway's Game Of Life workshop that is part of the programmieren-starten.de curriculum.
I understand it properly now and will add it to my little cheat sheet, 
can't wait to work with 3d or even 4d arrays so my brain gets fried completely anew hahaha.
